There are two ways of cropping - with standart functions of wordpress or by using built-in script (<a href="http://bfintal.github.io/bfi_thumb/" target="_blank">bfi thumbs</a>). To enable script cropping enable it in <strong>Theme Options - Global Enable\Disable - Enable resizer script</strong> (enabled by default). Then script create folder <em>wp-content/uploads/thumbs_dir</em> for thumbnails. On some servers script can't do this, so create it manual and set 777 permissions.</p>            <p>Sometimes, cropped images are not very good for you. So, you can try to disable cropping. Check <strong>Disable crop in resizer script</strong>            </p>            <p>If you want to use standart wordpress thumbnail cropping and you have any problems with the size of old images which uploaded before   install the theme you need to use <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/" target="_blank">Regenerate Thumbnails Plugin</a> or <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ajax-thumbnail-rebuild/" target="_blank">AJAX Thumbnail Rebuild Plugin</a> to regenerate thumbnails with suitable sizes.</p>          </div>        </section>        <section class="inline" id="11">                     <!-- title -->          <div class="top-title">            <p>Author profile <a href="#home" class="slideTo pull-right"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up"></i></a></p>          </div>          <!-- .title -->                    <div class="wrap">            <h4>Avatar setting</h4>            <p>The theme uses <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gravatar.com">Gravatar</a> to display users avatars . to craete or change your Gravatar : </p>            <strong>If you have never setup a Gravatar account:</strong>            <ol>              <li>Register / login to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gravatar.com">Gravatar</a>.

But REHub theme includes powerfull page builder that helps you to build custom pages. </p>            <p>From version 3.9 you can choose between built-in page builder and layout builder based on Visual Composer plugin.</p>            <p>There are some difference between these page builders. Built-in page builder has only 13 blocks and it works in content area. You can't set full width blocks with it, you can't set custom titles and mix content and content blocks. Layout builder is much more functional, so I recommend to use it. But, as any other layout builder plugins, visual composer creates more load on server and can cause some problems if you have weak hosting. </p>            <h3 id="vc">How to activate Layout builder</h3>            <p></p>            <p>At the top of each page in admin panel you will see such message</p>            <p><img src="images/109.png" alt=""/></p>            <p>Activate plugin, if you need it. </p>            <p>Layout builder gives you instruments to mix different content blocks with custom elements, like headings, icons, backgrounds, tabs, images. You can make your content full width, centered, boxed, in columns. Infinite possibilities for creating custom layouts. Also, many content blocks have enhanced sorting and ordering options. This is useful when you want to divide your content on logical parts. Layout builder is based on Visual composer plugin from codecanyon.</p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <h4>Some tips for layout builder.</h4>            <p>First of all, I recommend you to use &quot;Page for visual builder&quot; template on pages where you want to use visual composer. This is because such template has additional settings, where you can disable your header (this is good for landing pages), footer, disable default background, disable boxed style of content</p>            <p><img src="images/111.png" alt=""/></p>            <p>When you add any element, layout builder creates row for it. Each row has some important options.</p>            <p><img src="images/110.png" alt=""/></p>            <p><strong>Type of row width</strong></p>            <p>Inside content container means that row has inner width of parent container</p>            <p>Full width of content container makes width of row like parent content container.</p>            <p>Full width of browser window makes width of row ignore width of parent container.            </p>            <p><strong>Container with sidebar</strong></p>            <p>By default, if you want to add layout with widget area, your sidebar will be 270px (if you will use 3/4 + 1/4 column layout) or 384px (if you will use 2/3 + 1/3). It's not good for ads. So, to fix this and create static sidebar in this row, enable this option and use 2/3+1/3 layout. Or use predefinite visual composer template &quot;Row with sidebar area&quot;</p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p><strong>Make inner container center alignment?</strong></p>            <p>This option is good when you use width row as full width of browser window. Sometimes, it's good to have full width background color or background image, but text and other content place to center (this prevents stretching content)</p>            <h4>Inline, float, margin tips</h4>            <p>Most of elements has field <em>Extra class name</em>. I have made some useful classes which you can add to this field</p>            <p><strong>inlinestyle</strong> - use it if you want to make some elements on the same line. For example, some icons</p>            <p><strong>floatleft</strong> - this makes element float: left</p>            <p><strong>floatright</strong> - this makes element float: right</p>            <p><strong>font80</strong></p>            <p><strong>font90</strong></p>            <p><strong>font110</strong></p>            <p><strong>font120</strong></p>            <p><strong>font130</strong></p>            <p><strong>font140</strong> - By default, text block has font size as text block of theme content, but you can increase or reduce size. For examle, font80 - makes font size of text element 80% as default font size</p>            <p><strong>mr5</strong></p>            <p><strong>mr10</strong></p>            <p><strong>mr15</strong> - makes margin from right. mr5 - 5px, etc</p>            <p><strong>ml5</strong></p>            <p><strong>ml10</strong></p>            <p><strong>ml15</strong> - makes margin from left. mr5 - 5px, etc</p>            <p><strong>bg_r_b</strong> - set background image position to right bottom</p>            <p><strong>bg_r_t</strong> - to right top</p>            <p><strong>bg_l_b</strong> - to left bottom            </p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <h3>How to activate Built-in page builder</h3>            <p>To use it create any page and select in <strong>Page Attributes</strong> Template "Page Builder" and save page.

For example, first string has 5 posts and second - 5 posts and offset 5. So between these string you can insert ads block or any other block.</p>            </div>                      </div>        </section>        <section class="inline" id="22">                     <!-- title -->          <div class="top-title">            <p>How to set featured section on home page </p>            <p><a href="#home" class="slideTo pull-right"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up"></i></a></p>          </div>          <!-- .title -->                    <div class="wrap">            <p>One of simplest way to set featured section is to add such element from <a href="#vc" target="_blank">layout builder</a>. But if you don't want to use layout builder, you can set feature section from theme options. For this, make next steps.</p>            <p>First of all, you need to enable feature section. Go to theme option - Home page option and enable feature section. </p>            <p>You can set feature section based on tag or on manual selection.</p>            <p>First way - based on tag. Each post has a tags section. So, you can add definite tag name to all post which you want to show in feature slider. For example, add "feature" tag. Remember the name of this tag.</p>            <p><img src="images/86.png" alt="2"></p>            <p>Then you can add this name in option of feature section. (leave blank other fields)</p>            <p><img src="images/87.png" alt="2"></p>            <p>Second way - choose posts for feature section. Each post has Post settings. If you want this post to be in feature section - just choose it as featured and choose a place for it (in slider or in right section).</p>            <p><img src="images/88.png" alt="2"></p>            <p><img src="images/89.png" alt="2"></p>            <p>Then you need to choose these posts in options of feature section. Also, you can leave this fields blank, so last featured posts will be displayed.</p>            <p><img src="images/90.png" alt="2"></p>            <p>Another usefull option - overlay layer on slider. You need to use it, for example, if your images have white color. So, white text of slider will be not visible on white images and you need to add some overlay layer on images of slider. </p>            <p><img src="images/91.png" alt="2"></p>          </div>        </section>        <section class="inline" id="23">                     <!-- title -->          <div class="top-title">            <p>How to set carousel on home page <a href="#home" class="slideTo pull-right"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up"></i></a></p>          </div>          <!-- .title -->                    <div class="inline-content">            <p><img src="images/22.png" alt="2"></p>            <p>It's very easy.

There are many supported shops and affiliate sites. You need just to insert link from product page ofshop to plugin page and plugin will parse to your site all information about product (link, price, title, description, photo and even specifications, comments, etc). You can also add multiple products or link on shop category.Then you choose output template. Plugin has near 6 templates, but Rehub theme increases this number to 20 different templates (product cart, comparison lists, buttons, carousels, tabbed cart, etc) + 3 custom widget. All theme's custom templates has postfix [custom], so, use them if you want to have good looking blocks. </p>            <p>See video with some of examples</p>            <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0zvplPxeuWs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>            <p>Plugin is paid. It's price $45, but, good news, Rehub Theme buyers will get plugin license only for $20. If you bought our two themes or licenses - plugin will cost $15 for you. If you bought 3 or more - plugin will be free for you. To get your plugin license, please, write on my email from <a href="http://themeforest.net/user/sizam#contact">contact form</a></p><p>Currently, plugin supports more than 40 shops. Among them: <ul>    <li>Amazon.com</li>    <li>    Aliexpress</li>       <li> Babadu</li>       <li> Ebay.com</li>       <li> iHerb.com</li>       <li> Pleer</li>       <li> Ozon</li>       <li> Quelle</li>       <li> Tom Tailor</li>       <li> Topbrands</li>       <li> Wikimart</li>       <li> Yves Rocher</li>       <li> Yoox</li>       <li> Rendezvous</li>    </ul></p><p>If you want to get any shop to supported shop list - write to us and we can make parser for you. Also, you can try to make your parser. Examples of parser you can find in folder plugin_folder/application/shop/parsers. To make custom parser, create folder with name <em>affegg-parsers</em> in theme folder</p><h2>Affiliate Egg instructions</h2><p>First of all, you can add to each storefront 3 types of links. 1 - single link, 2 - multiple links, 3 - link on catalog</p><p>When you add link on catalog - add before link such code to limit parsed items. Example, [catalog limit=10]http://supershop.com/super-catalog</p><p>After parsing of product data, plugin will generate shortcode - insert it on your page. Example, [affegg id=10]</p><p>There are some tips for the shortcode. If you added multiple products or catalog, you can use shortcode [affegg id=10 next=3] This will show only first 3 position. If you add in content of post this shortcode again - this will show next 3 positions, etc. Also, you can use shortcode [affegg id=10 offset=5 limit=3] - to show 3 items from fifth position. </p><h3>Deeplink</h3><p>To get comission from affiliate links, you must add deeplink (partner link ID or parameter). Each shop and affiliate system have it's own deeplink. Add not only ID, but also a name of parameter, for example, for Iherb.com you must add <em>rcode=PVT241</em>, not just PVT241</p><h3>Auto updating and other settings</h3><p>Plugin have autoupdating of products. You can set time of delay in settings. Also, there are some other usefull settings. For example, <strong>Save meta to post</strong>.

The most unique feature is hybrid system with many relations between affiliate store, review posts, link cloaker, products. Let's talk about different ways of affiliate settings</p>            <p>First of all, you need to answer on some questions. How many affiliate products do you have? How offten do you plan to change prices, links of products? Does your product has only one link or lists of affiliate links? Do you want to create separate product page or not? Do you want to auto update prices with some plugins?</p>            <p>Theme provides 3 ways of affiliate options. Manual inserting in post, connecting posts to thirstyaffiliates offers and connecting posts to woocommerce offers.</p>            <p>Manual inserting - good if you want to have logic one post - one product.</p>            <p>Thirstylink is better if you have average number of affiliate products, when you want to create offers list with best price, offers archives, cloak links, track links, add coupons. Thirstyaffiliates offers are virtual, so, each offer don't have separate page</p>            <p>Woocommerce offers is most powerful. Each offer has it's own separate page, can be added automatically (with wp all in one import plugin or similar), can be auto updating. Each offer can be added to comparison, wishlist. You can sell this offers from your site (just setup offer as simple product) or can be as affiliate external link (setup offer as external product). Also each offer can have specification, coupons. You can also create lists of offers, archives, etc. </p>            <h3>Manual settings in review posts</h3>            <p>From 4.4 version you can add offers to section Post offer.</p>            <p><img src="images/116.png"  alt=""/></p>            <p>Good thing - now you don't need to set post as review for using this option. This means that you can add offer to any post type.</p>            <p>In post offer section you can add price, coupons, date of ending of coupons, also, coupons can have reveal function.</p>            <h4>Review post with product review</h4>            <p><img src="images/35.png"></p>            <p>For creating such posts, create post setting like on image above. After this you will see additional fields. First field I will describe in next part of tutorial. You can leave it blank. Then you can add description, thumbnail, price, button url, coupon and even enable countdown.  So, when you publish your page, product offer appears on page</p>            <p><img src="images/36.png" width="662" height="206"></p>            <p>Default place of product offer is bottom of content, before review, but you can insert this block at any place of content. You need to enable "shortcode inserting" for this.</p>            <h3>Offerbox shortcode</h3>            <p>Another way to inserting offer to post is using built in shortcode plugin. </p>            <p><img src="images/19.png" width="475" height="84"></p>            <p>Choose Offer Box shortcode and fill all fields. Please, don't use many symbols in button text. Good example is "see offer", "buy this".</p>            <p>Offer box with shortcode looks the same, but it has some differences. First of all, offer box shortcode can be used in any post formats, even in music post formats. But, when you create product review, your data will be saved in post and can be used on other pages (for example, in top lists)</p>          </div>        </section>        <section class="inline" id="28">                     <!-- title -->          <div class="top-title">            <p>ThirstyAffiliate plugin <a href="#home" class="slideTo pull-right"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up"></i></a></p>          </div>          <!-- .title -->                    <div class="inline-content">            <p>From version 2.0 theme has bundled Affiliate Link Builder (plugin ThirstyAffiliate). This plugin can cloak your links and has many others good options. I created enhanced relations between this plugin and theme. First of all, you need to install it.</p>            <p><img src="images/26.png"> </p>            <p>Click on link to begin installing plugin. After installing, activate plugin. Now, you can see new post type</p>            <p><img src="images/27.png"></p>            <p>You can use affiliate link builder in two ways: as simple link cloaker and as affiliate offer builder. If you want use it only as link cloaker, just add in link only name and Destination URL. After saving you will get cloaked url. </p>            <p>Also you can use it as offer builder. For this, you need to set all fields. After saving, you can choose affiliate link-offer in different options of theme. Each link will be not only cloaked link, but like full offer with name, description, brand, image, button and link.</p>            <p>For example, in product review, that I described early, you can choose this affiliate offer</p>            <p><img src="images/42.png"></p>            <p>So, if you choose affiliate offer in this field, you don't need to manually set all others fields below, because data for each field will be parsed from data of affiliate offer from affiliate link builder.</p>            <p>Another good option that I added from version 2.9 of theme - is image for category of links. Let me explain on example. Each offer has it's own thumbnail</p>            <p><img src="images/37.png"></p>            <p>You can add this thumbnail at this place</p>            <p><img src="images/38.png"></p>            <p>First image from this field will be used as thumbnail. But very often people use for this thumbnail logo of shop, for example logo of amazon or ebay. So, you need to upload this logo to every affiliate link. But from version 2.9 you can upload this image not for each link offer but for each brand. For this, create new category for links. Each category will be brand or shop. For example, create category and name it "Ebay". </p>            <p><img src="images/39.png"></p>            <p>Then insert link to image of brand logo</p>            <p><img src="images/40.png"></p>            <p>If you want to use this logo as offer thumbnail, just don't attach any image in link offer and set category with shop image.</p>            <p><img src="images/41.png"></p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <h3>How to create product review with affiliate offers list</h3>            <p>Sometimes, you'd like to create product review that has many offers from different shops. No problem, REHub has such options. Just choose type of review - product review with affiliate links list</p>            <p><img src="images/43.png"></p>            <p>Affiliate list has one description of product and unlimited number of offers.</p>            <p><img src="images/30.png"></p>            <div class="notice danger"><strong>Please, set manually your main currency on theme option - Reviews option - Main currency. Just add symbol, like "$".</strong></div>          </div>        </section>        <section class="inline" id="30">                     <!-- title -->          <div class="top-title">            <p>Woocommerce affiliate products <a href="#home" class="slideTo pull-right"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up"></i></a></p>          </div>          <!-- .title -->                    <div class="inline-content">            <p>Another good way that I really love - using woocommerce for affiliate products. I am surprised, but many people don't know that woocommerce has awesome functions for this. You need only to choose type of product - Affiliate product when you create your woocommerce product. </p>            <p><img src="images/44.png"></p>            <p>Woocommerce offer products has many advantaged before others. First of all - each affiliate product has it's own page. Second - your affiliate product has many unique woocommerce functions. For example, you can add specification of each product and all products can be compared by each other or can be added to wishlist (install plugins YITH Woocommerce Compare and YITH WooCommerce Wishlist for this). Third - you have products store page with filters, so you can use it like catalogue page.            </p>            <p>And, of course, I add relations between theme and woocommerce products. You need only to choose type of product review "Woocommerce product review" and choose product in select field after this. And you get such beautifull and good conversion block in your review page</p>            <p><img src="images/45.png"></p>            <p>Your users can buy product, view specification and photos of product from review page, so they don't need to do additional click to see your woocommerce product. Less clicks - more conversion.</p>            <p>Also. If you want to create list of offers - choose type of review - Product review with woocommerce offers list and choose your woocommerce offers.</p>            <p><strong>How to add cloaking of links to woocommerce external links</strong></p>            <p>It's easy, just install plugin https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-cloak-affiliate-links/</p>          </div>        </section>                <section class="inline" id="29">                     <!-- title -->          <div class="top-title">            <p>How to create archives of offers <a href="#home" class="slideTo pull-right"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up"></i></a></p>          </div>          <!-- .title -->                    <div class="inline-content">            <p>In ReHub theme you can create different archives fro your products.

Note, version of plugin that bundled in theme works only with theme. If you use it outside REHub theme you will have some bugs. But all functions are the same and all <a href="http://wordpress-filter.com/documentation/" target="_blank">shortcodes and documentations</a> from this plugin work the same way.</p>		<p></p>		<p>I will try to describe all process and tricks to setup directory, filtered catalogue, product specification and using of directory constructor of theme. </p>		<h3>Installing plugin</h3>		<p>First of all, you need to install and activate plugin. From 3.0 version you can see notification in top of admin panel.</p>		<p><strong>This theme recommends the following plugin: <em>Meta filter (for creating catalogs and specification)</em>.</strong></p>		<p>So, install and activate plugin. Now, you will have <strong>MDTF Filters</strong> tab in admin panel. Go to MDTF Settings where by checkboxes set post types we want to use. It's working with any post type, so, you can create filtered directory from your posts or create new post types\add to existing new criterias. For example, you can create filtered directory from your easydigitaldownloads products or woocommerce products. You can create real estate, car, gadget, laptops, events directory on your site. </p>		<p>Next, you need to think about logic of your catalogue and create set of filters. Each filter is like position in specification. You can add any number of fields in filter, but I recommend you to group all fields into filters. For example, I want to create camera review website. I take specification of camera.</p>		<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" style="width: 100%;" class="table table-striped">			<tbody>				<tr>					<td>Body type</td>					<td class="value">Compact</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>Max resolution</td>					<td class="value">5472 x 3648</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>Effective pixels</td>					<td class="value">20 <span class="unitsSuffix">megapixels</span></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>Sensor size</td>					<td class="value">1″ (13.2 x 8.8 mm)</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>Sensor type</td>					<td class="value">BSI-CMOS</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>ISO</td>					<td class="value">Auto, 125-12800</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>Focal length (equiv.)</td>					<td class="value">24&ndash;100 <span class="unitsSuffix">mm</span></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>Optical zoom</td>					<td class="value">4.2<span class="unitsSuffix">×</span></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>Articulated LCD</td>					<td class="value">Tilting</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>Screen size</td>					<td class="value">3<span class="unitsSuffix">″</span></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>Screen dots</td>					<td class="value">1,040,000</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>Min shutter speed</td>					<td class="value">40 <span class="unitsSuffix">sec</span></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>Max shutter speed</td>					<td class="value">1/2000 <span class="unitsSuffix">sec</span></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>Format</td>					<td class="value">MPEG-4, H.264</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>Storage types</td>					<td class="value">SD/SDHC/SDXC (UHS-I compatible)</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>USB</td>					<td class="value"> USB 2.0 <small>(480 Mbit/sec)</small></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>Weight (inc. batteries)</td>					<td class="value">304 <span class="unitsSuffix">g</span> (0.67 <span class="unitsSuffix">lb</span> / 10.72 <span class="unitsSuffix">oz</span>)</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>Dimensions</td>					<td class="value">103 x 60 x 40 <span class="unitsSuffix">mm</span> (4.06 x 2.36 x 1.57<span class="unitsSuffix">″</span>)</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>GPS</td>					<td class="value">None</td>				</tr>			</tbody>		</table>		<p>So, my filters will be: Body type, Max resolution, Effective pixels, Sensor size, etc. As you can see, each criteria has only one value, but sometimes your criteria will have multiply options. For example, </p>		<table class="table table-striped">			<tr class="odd">				<td class="item-name"><strong>Autofocus</strong></td>				<td class="item-value"><ul>						<li>Contrast Detect (sensor)</li>						<li>Multi-area</li>						<li>Center</li>						<li>Selective single-point</li>						<li>Single</li>						<li>Continuous</li>						<li>Touch</li>						<li>Face Detection</li>						<li>Live View</li>					</ul></td>			</tr>		</table>		<p>In this cases you need to add many fields to each filter. Let's do this job with me to make process more clear.</p>		<p>Add supported post type in plugin settings, then create MDTF category. Category is like group of filters, this is very usefull if you have different type of products with different filters. </p>		<p>Ok, add new filter. Title of filter will be title of criteria in specification. It will be used in widget </p>		<p><img src="images/48.png"  alt="48"></p>		<p>and in specification shortcode</p>		<p><img src="images/49.png"  alt="49"></p>		<div class="notice warning">Tip - If We do not want to show title of the filter on the front, no problems print tilde sign before title <strong>~</strong></div>		<p>Next step - is to set fields. You can add taxonomies,checkboxes,drop-downs, range-sliders, calendars and textinputs. Most of cases you will need checkboxes and sliders. All settings for each field is available after click on toggle button.</p>		<p><strong>Checkboxes</strong> has option to be true or false. So, you need this field for creating something like this</p>		<p><img src="images/50.png"  alt="50"></p>		<p>Checkboxes is the most quicker html items when we talk about adding them to filter: press Append Item and write its title, that is all, do not even toggle the item box, it is checkbox by default. </p>		<p>Important thing - checkboxes in specification will have only title, so it's title will be also it's value. Like this. </p>		<p><img src="images/51.png" alt="51"></p>		<p>Next field is <strong>dropdown</strong>. The main difference from checkbox is that dropdown has title and values. It's usefull for criterias that can have only one value from set of values. For example, </p>		<p><img src="images/54.png" alt="54"></p>		<p>And, of course, instead of creating one dropbox with values, you can create set of checkboxes. </p>		<p>Dropdown has such look in specification</p>		<p><img src="images/52.png"  alt="52"></p>		<p>Next field is <strong>slider</strong>. It's used for creating numbered field with slider. </p>		<p>&nbsp;</p>		<p><img src="images/53.png" alt="53"></p>		<p>The look in specification is absolutely the same as previous. It has title and value. What if we have 8 products worth 1000$ and 2 for 5000$, it is not convenient set range from 0 to 5000 because of this 2 items. Here is a pair of interesting moments,  if your customer will drag left slider to the right, and no touch left one ajax-recount will show him 8+2 items because by the logic recount of price goes from minimal value to bigger, so and that 5000$ items will be in search. And if your customer drag the left slider to the right, to 1000, so ajax recount will show all items from 1000 to infinity.</p>		<p>Next field is calendar, but It's very easy. Can be used for event date or date of product release. </p>		<p>Next field - is <strong>textinput</strong>. It uses in very exceptional cases. It has function as simple wordpress search by text. For example, you add some product description by this field and users can enter word (s) in this field. If item has such words in this field, filter will be active. For example, you can duplicate title of your product in this field, so users can search products by title. Also, sometimes I add quick specification or small product description in this field and use it in another places of theme (for example, in top review lists)</p>		<p><img src="images/55.png" alt="55"></p>		<p>Here is last html item – <strong>taxonomy</strong>, if you add this to the filter it  means only that in this place will be placed taxonomies which will be  selected in widget or shortcode (will be described hereinafter) and  nothing more else. Its cant be reflected. And one more, remember this –  to show selected taxonomies which were selected in widget or shortcode  you should add taxonomy html item to filter=) Just drop it and forget!</p>		<p>After creating filter, don't forget to add it to some category and save. Also you can set it's position in Sequence attribute. </p>		<p>		<hr />		<p></p>		<div class="notice info"><strong>Tips.</strong> Item meta key by default is not beauty, like this <em>medafi_5393540d4024e</em>, and this is will work as a metakey, to make it beauty it is enough to rename it, for example rename key as <em>medafi_price</em> and press <strong>change meta key </strong>button. Ajax request will show as that it changed. Important: the key must begins with <em>medafi_</em> prefix!  So, add good names, because sometimes you will need to use this metakey in theme.</div>		<p><strong>Heights</strong>: On front widget – means max height of the current filter on front after which scroll appears: </p>		<p><img src="images/57.png" alt="57"></p>		<h4>Reflections</h4>		<p>Now very important moment when we are talking about Price or scores that already exist in your posts! The plugin sometimes bought when site works already, and products or posts already have price or other values that saved in metakeys that already exist. Now, you can reflect this value and use it in filters. For this, just add name of this custom field. </p>		<p><img src="images/56.png" alt="56"></p>		<p>&nbsp;</p>		<div class="notice info"><p><strong>Tips.</strong>The name of overall score custom field in REHub - rehub_review_overall_score</p>		<p>If you added connect thirstylink affiliate products to posts, you can reflect it's price - rehub_main_product_price</p></div>		 </div>        </section>                <section class="inline" id="38">                     <!-- title -->          <div class="top-title">            <p>Adding data <a href="#home" class="slideTo pull-right"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up"></i></a></p>          </div>          <!-- .title -->                    <div class="inline-content"> 		<p>After filter setup you need to add data to each of your post. For this, choose your category of filter and add your data</p>		<p><img src="images/58.png" alt="58"></p>		<p>Now one moment. Imagine situation that you have 500 products and we want to filter them by taxonomies and price which is reflected in built-in constructor. It is very big work to select in each product by hands filter-category. To make it for 1 min you can do next: go to filter-categories and press ours one, look its ID in browser address row </p>		<p><img src="images/59.png"  alt="5"></p>		<p>in our case it is 74</p>		<p>Go to the plugins settings and scroll on the same bottom of the page  </p>		<p><img src="images/60.png"  alt="60">and set data as on screen. Select post type we need, in our case  here it is product. Press Assign. After the page reloading for all ours  500 products were set filter-category we need. We can use this when it is lazy for us each time select filter-category in each product =). That is all, we have filters, we have data in posts, next we need set widget in sidebar or shortcode somewhere</p></div>        </section>                <section class="inline" id="39">                     <!-- title -->          <div class="top-title">            <p>Setting widget and forms for filter <a href="#home" class="slideTo pull-right"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up"></i></a></p>          </div>          <!-- .title -->                    <div class="inline-content"> <p>Now, you need to understand logic of directory pages. First of all, you need create page for output template + form with filters. REHub theme has many predefinite templates and shortcodes for this to create any type of catalogue. I will try to explain on examples. </p>		<hr />		<h2>Work with widgets</h2>		<p>The plugin has 2 widget to filter: <strong><em>MDTF</em></strong> and <strong><em>MDTF Taxonomies only</em></strong>.  We need first when we are going to filter post by meta data and  taxonomies on the same time. Second can filter by taxonomies only, we  can use it after the plugin installation – drop to any sidebar you need  and go. So lets consider first widget. If you are planning to use second  widget read this instructions too, it is useful for understanding some  moments.</p>		<p>Drop the widget in sidebar, write title, select filter-category we are going to filter with. Make your attention to 2 checkboxes on the screen: <em>Hide meta values filter options</em> – check it if you are going to filter by taxonomies only, meta options will not be shown on the front, <em>Hide taxonomies values filter options</em> – check this if you are going to filter by meta values only, taxonomies  will be hidden on the front. By the way if you want to filter data only  by taxonomies only check  <em>Hide meta values filter options</em> another way errors, and vice versa. As  we drop the widget just now press save to init JavaScript properly. We  do it only on first time after dropping the widget on the sidebar.</p>		<p>Next, very important things</p>		<p></p>		<p><img src="images/61.png" alt="66"></p>		<p><strong>Results output page link</strong>- this is a page url where user will see results of filtered content.</p>		<p>By default, when you activate your plugin, new page &quot;MDTF Results Page&quot; will be added automatically. And it will be used as output page link by default. <span class="text-danger">But I strongly recommend you to set url where you have your catalogue in this field</span></p>		<p><strong>Results output template</strong> is a template file of theme which is used for results display. By default, it uses search page template, but it's not very well, so I added some awesome templates for creating your directory + catalogue constructor + some ajaxed templates. See next chapters for description of templates </p>		<p>Reset link - is link where user will be redirected after clicking on reset button. I recommend to set the same url as Results output page link</p>        <h4>Another settings of data filter widget</h4>		<p>Let's consider taxonomy block in the widget. Do you remember what I  wrote about taxonomy html-item in filter, so which taxonomies must be on  front decided is here, just check them and save the widget</p>		<p>Lets consider taxonomy options when you are pressing Options button. You  can select here how the taxonomy will appears on the front: checkbox or  drop-down. You can select title for first option of the taxonomy if it  is drop-down, select which terms to hide if you are not want to show  them </p>		<p><img src="images/72.png" alt="ss"></p>		<p>One  secret! Imagine that you have taxonomy Locations, and want to show this  as: Countries, Regions, Cities – parent,child,child – and each has its  own title of first option. It simple, just write in textinput <em>Custom name/title for taxonomies</em>: Countries^Regions^Cities</p>		<p>If you selected the taxonomy view as checkboxes, another option appeared <em>Block max height</em> – you need to set it in pixels if you have for example 300 terms and  such high box can broke your layout on front. If you set this max height  scroll bar will appear if block takes more than 300 px.</p>        		<h4>How to make filter widget with white background</h4>		<p>Just open style.css file of theme and find in bottom such code</p>		<pre>/***for dark widget - you can delete if you want white widget***/<br>.sidebar .widget.widget-meta-data-filter { background-color: #212121; color: #fff; padding: 20px }<br>.sidebar .widget.widget-meta-data-filter h3, .sidebar .widget.widget-meta-data-filter h5 { color: #fff }<br>.sidebar .widget.widget-meta-data-filter h4.data-filter-section-title { background-color: #5b5b5b; color: #ffffff; margin: 20px -20px 10px !important; padding: 10px 20px; }<br>.sidebar .widget.widget-meta-data-filter .mdf_textinput, .sidebar .widget.widget-meta-data-filter select { border: 1px solid #fff; }<br>.sidebar .mdf_widget_found_count { background-color: transparent; color: #fff; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold !important; padding: 0; }<br>.sidebar .widget.widget-meta-data-filter .mdf_range_max, .sidebar .widget.widget-meta-data-filter .mdf_range_min, .sidebar .widget.widget-meta-data-filter .mdf_calendar{ border: 1px solid #fff}<br>/*** ***/</pre>		<p>Delete it. That's all</p>		<h4>How to add filter widget only on page with catalog</h4>		<p>Use for this plugin <em>Woosidebar</em> that bundled in theme. Also I recommend you do not use plugin <em>custom sidebars</em> for this purpose.</p>		<hr />                        <h2>Adding form by shortcode</h2>		<p>Adding filter form by shortcode has very simillar logic, but more customizable. </p>		<p>First difference, that you can choose what fields to include to form.</p>		<p><img src="images/76.png"  alt="76"></p>		<p>&nbsp;</p>		<p>Also, you can choose taxonomy.</p>		<p>There is one feature in shortcodes – skins, you can select how your shortcode will appear on front </p>		<p><img src="images/77.png"  alt="77"></p>		<p>I created some skins for you. </p>		<p><em>Default</em> and <em>dark</em> - is shortcodes by default. It has 3 column and button in the end.</p>		<p><em>Defaultfullwidth</em> and <em>darkfullwidth</em> - is form that you can use with full width layout. It has 4 column.</p>		<p>Also, I create <em>darkmobile</em> and <em>defaultmobile</em> shortcodes. What do they mean? As you know, mobiles has small resolution, so website has only one column on mobiles. Sidebar is displayed at bottom of page, and when you add filter widget to sidebar it will be visible under all content. So, if you want to show filter form also before catalogue results (but only on mobiles), choose this layout.</p>		<p>After saving shortcode, copy code and paste in any page where you want to see form</p>		<p>Also, you can use shortcode styles <em>darksidebar</em> and <em>whitesidebar</em> for using shortcodes in sidebar text widget. Why do you need them if you have MDTF widget? Because filter form by shortcode have a good and useful function - you can hide any field or group of fields.</p>		<p><img src="images/78.png" alt="78"></p>		</div>        </section>                <section class="inline" id="res_tem">                     <!-- title -->          <div class="top-title">            <p>Results output templates </p>            <p><a href="#home" class="slideTo pull-right"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up"></i></a></p>          </div>          <!-- .title -->                    <div class="inline-content">           		<p>There are some ways to set MDTF output</p>		<h4 id="filtervc">1 way - with visual composer.</h4>		<p> From 3.9.2 version of theme you have very easy way to install mdtf output on page.

(<a href="#vc" target="_blank">see how you can enable visual composer in theme</a>)</p>		<p><img src="images/112.png" alt=""/></p>		<p>Add it to page. If you have sidebar or shortcode that works only on page with output, set the same name &quot;self&quot; for output link and for reset link in settings of mdtf widget or shortcode. If you have sidebar with mdtf widget overall whole site, you need to set output link as the link of page where you inserted MDTF module. </p>		<p>Also, in settings of module, you can enable ajax mode of working. But, note, for correct work, you need to have widget or shortcode with enabled ajax mode on the same page. </p>        <p><img src="images/105.png" width="503" height="514" alt=""/></p><h4>2 way. <em>Creating filterable top table</em></h4>       <p><a href="http://rehub.wpsoul.net/top-reviews-with-sidebar/" target="_blank">Demo of this template with filter</a></p>       <p>You can connect your top table with filters.

Let me explain each setting. </p>		<p><em>Enable title of page before posts?</em> - if you enable this, your catalogue will have title.</p>		<p><em>Enable content of page before posts?</em> - this will include content of page before catalogue items</p>		<p><img src="images/65.png"  alt="44"></p>		<p></p>		<p><img src="images/66.png"  alt="55"></p>		<p>&nbsp;</p>		<p><em>Choose design of posts</em> - there are 3 different type of design</p>		<p><em>Fetch Count</em> - this is how many posts you would like to show on one page. I recommend to use 9 or 12 for 3 column design, and 10 for lists and 2 column.</p>		<p><em>Name of post type</em> - this option is very usefull if you want to create directory from custom post type. Set name of any post type. Most of plugins create custom post type and you can use any of them to create your unique catalogue. </p>		<p><img src="images/67.png" alt="44"></p>		<p>&nbsp;</p>		<p><em>Show taxonomy</em> - another good option, that you can show in results any custom taxonomy. </p>		<p><img src="images/68.png"  alt="68"></p>		<p>&nbsp;</p>		<p><em>Show exerpt</em> - if you want to show exerpt, set how many symbols.</p>		<p><em>Add values from custom fields</em></p>		<p>These great set of option will make many developers and customers very happy. Now, you can show any value from custom meta fields of your website. Each set of fields has it's own icon, title and value + css class, so, if you know css, you can create unique style of catalogue without php codding. Only with use of css. </p>		<p>Also, in previous part I tell you how to set names of custom fields with plugin.

First of all, it's using shortcode. You can insert shortcode </p>		<pre>[downloads]</pre>		<p>at content of any page. It generates list of products. This shortcode has many options (note, options: full_content, columns are not working in theme). For example, you can add only one product inside any page content. Just add [downloads ids="11"], where 11 - is id of download product.</p>		<img src="images/34.png">		<p>Also, this shortcode you can use in custom block in page builder. </p>		<p>Another way - is to set direct link into your menu to archive of download products. Link is http://yoursite.com/downloads. But don't forget to renew permalink structure. Just go to <strong>settings - Permalinks</strong> and resave settings without any changes. Also, each category and tag of download product has it's own page. </p>		<p>Theme has option to choose 3 different types of layout for archives of easy digital downloads. List (like from shortcode), grid with sidebar, and full width grid. Also you can use built-in simple user rating system for products. Settings for this you can find in <strong>theme options - easydigitaldownloads</strong></p>		<p>Ok, now you need to add cart and detail widget for sidebar. I think the best way is to setting individual widget area only for downloads product pages. For this, try to use Woosidebar plugin that bundled with theme. </p>		<p>And, for better looking system pages of plugin, I recommend you to set full width template for page "checkout" and sub-pages.</p>	</div>        </section>                <section class="inline" id="48">                     <!-- title -->          <div class="top-title">            <p>Ads and branding <a href="#home" class="slideTo pull-right"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up"></i></a></p>          </div>          <!-- .title -->                    <div class="wrap">		<p>Ads and Branded page is very important thing for moneymakers, so I decide to include enhanced options for ads and branding. </p>        <h3>Branded background</h3>		<p>Every post and page can be branded by customized background, cover background with url, wide banner zone before content.

Also you can set branded banner for category. For this, you need to go to category edit page in admin (Posts - Categories) and edit category. Now, you can see two fields: Target url, Category banner image url. First field is a link where your banner will go. It's not required. Second field is a direct link to your banner image. </p>		<p><img src="images/17.png"  alt="17"></p>		<p>It's recommended that you insert pictures 1200px wide. </p>		<p>All options may be set globaly on <strong>Theme Options - Ads options</strong> or for each page or post separately in <em>branded page option</em> panel</p>		<h3>Ads zones</h3>		<p>Our theme has huge of ads areas.</p>		<p>For adding ads to banner zone go to <strong>Theme Option - Ads option</strong>.

Create gallery of images and insert it in post. No matter what gallery settings you set, so leave it by default. Then go to text view of visual editor. In place where gallery added you find code like</p>		<pre>[gallery ids=&quot;1042,1041,1040,1043&quot;]</pre>		<p>Copy only ids, it will be like 1042,1041,1040,1043 and erase gallery shortcode. Click on theme shortcode button. Choose Gallery carousel shortcode, then you can add title of gallery, insert copied ids. And click insert button for adding to post. That's all, enjoy. </p>		<h5>How to add notice on your ads when users use adblock plugin</h5>		<p>From version 2.2.0 you have an option to set notice on your ads when people use adblock that cuts ads. Go to theme option - Ads option to enable this option. If you want to add such notice to your post (or widget ads), just wrap your add with </p>		<pre>&lt;div class=&quot;mediad&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre> </div>        </section>                      <section class="inline" id="52">                     <!-- title -->          <div class="top-title">            <p>How to improve speed of website and caching <a href="#home" class="slideTo pull-right"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up"></i></a></p>          </div>          <!-- .title -->                    <div class="wrap">		<p>First of all, I want to tell you that if you have slow hosting you can't get good speed for your site even you are a master of caching websites. How to check your hosting? I want to give you advice. Go to your admin panel of wordpress. If it loads very slow - you need to change your hosting. </p>		<p>Ok, you have good hosting. Let's do some improvements.</p>		<p>First of all, if you use many ADS on page + social buttons + external scripts - you can't get A grade, because you can't cache external scripts and you lose many points. But, even if you don't get A grade, don't upset. The most important thing - is your site speed. It must be under 5 second. 3 second - good, 1 second - awesome. Even if you get C grade, but your site loads under 1 second - this is perfect.</p>		<p>Also some words about speed of mobile version in google page speed. Currently, to get more then 90 points in mobile version, google recommends to put css files outside html tags or load css asynchronous. Loading css files outside html is awful violation of all web standarts. I don't know why google recommends do this, but it's wrong. It's possible to load files asynchronous, but there are no universal instruments for this. When they will appear, I will add them in article. Anyway, google page speed is only recommendations, sometimes they are very strange, for example, they don't recommend to use fonts from google CDN...</p>		<p>Let's talk about some ways to get good speed and some cache plugins.</p>		<h3><strong>1. Wp Super cache + Autoptimize + htaccess tricks.</strong> </h3>		<p>Also, You can use Hyper cache instead of Super cache or other plugins</p>		<p>I very like this way, because Wp Super cache is one of the cache plugins that don't conflict with many other plugins. And it's very easy. I don't change any settings, just enable it. </p>		<p>There is <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/installation/" target="_blank">installation tips and faq for wp super cache</a>		</p>		<p>Next thing that you can do - minify js,css cache. You can use next good plugin <strong>Autoptimize</strong>. After enabling, you need to enable different options. </p>		<p>In difference from others cache plugins, it's more safety. If you have troubles with other plugins, try to do next. Enable advanced options</p>		<p>&nbsp;</p>		<p><img src="images/85.png"  alt="55"></p>		<p>&nbsp;</p>		<p>and try to check <em>Force JavaScript in &lt;head&gt;</em> and <em>Look for styles only in &lt;head&gt;</em>. For example, if you use built-in meta filter plugin, I recommend you to check <em>Look for styles only in &lt;head&gt;</em> or many functions of plugin will not work.</p>		<p>Next thing that you can add for geting more points and speed - set file expiry. For this, you need to add some code to your file .htaccess. You can do this from admin panel if you use Seo by Yoast plugin. Just go to SEO - Edit files.</p>		<p>Add to the end of file such code</p>		<hr />		<p># ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>			# Expires headers (for better cache control)<br>			# ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>			# These are pretty far-future expires headers.<br>			# They assume you control versioning with filename-based cache busting<br>			# Additionally, consider that outdated proxies may miscache<br>		#   http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2008/08/23/revving-filenames-dont-use-querystring/</p>		<p># If you don't use filenames to version, lower the CSS and JS to something like<br>			# &quot;access plus 1 week&quot;.<br>			&lt;IfModule mod_expires.c&gt;<br>			ExpiresActive on</p>		<p># Perhaps better to whitelist expires rules?

You can set page, object, browser, files, CDN, etc.</p>		<p>This is very powerfull plugin with huge of settings. The main problem - very often conflicts with different plugins. </p>		<p>I can recommend this plugin if you don't use many plugins. </p>		<p>If you have problems with theme with this plugin, in 99% cases this is because conflict W3 Total Cache with one of your plugin. In 90% cases this is because js and css minify. So, if you have such problems on frontend (for example, all tabs, sliders, grids are broken) - just disable css and js minify. </p>		<p><a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-install-and-setup-w3-total-cache-for-beginners/" target="_blank">Tutorial for setup W3 Total Cache</a></p>		<h3>I made all changes, but still have bad points</h3>		<p>In this case you need to see what things cause problem. </p>		<p>In most of cases, google page speed grabs many points because of using many external scripts and files. Such files can't be cached and they don't have expiration time for browsers. So, check next</p>		<p>1. How many ads widgets or ads zones you are using. It's very good if only one or nothing</p>		<p>2. How many google fonts are you using. By default theme has only one google font - Open Sans Condensed for Re:Hub and Montserrat+Noto Serif for Re:Thing. You can disable even them (but typography may be not good after this). </p>		<p>For disabling default font in RE:Hub, just delete stroke in functions.php </p>		<p>wp_enqueue_style('default_font', '//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans+Condensed:300,700&amp;subset=latin,cyrillic');</p>		<p>or in RE:Thing </p>		<p> wp_enqueue_style('font_nav', '//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Noto+Serif:400,700');<br>wp_enqueue_style('head_nav', '//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat:700');</p>		<p>3. Do you load font awesome from external cdn or not. For better points, check in<strong> theme options - global enable/disable - Font Awesome icons fallback</strong> to ON. In this case fontawesome font will load from your site and it's better for points</p>		<p>4. Do you have other external js scripts? If you have, google show them all. For example, some plugins can load google maps on all pages of site. </p>		<p>5. Images. See next chapter for this</p>		<h3>Some words about images</h3>		<p>Unfortunatelly, wordpress have very awful image handling. You can add image sizes in theme, but, by default wordpress generates ALL image sizes, even if you not use some sizes on your site. This is bad, because, for example, my theme has more than 40 different content blocks, each block has it's own image sizes. If I will generate image for all of them, your disk on server will be full very fast. So, some of images resized by css and google page speed don't like this. I am trying to optimize this, but it's hard to make this for all sites of buyers. Because some people like big images, some like croped, some like square, tall, white background, etc. </p>		<p>But you can try some things to improve images.</p>		<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ewww-image-optimizer/" target="_blank">EWWW Image Optimizer</a></p>		<p>After installing this plugin, all new images will be optimized. Also, you can optimize your existing images. </p>		<p>For this, go to settings of plugin - Advanced settings. And set url of thumbnails folder to <strong>Folders to optimize</strong>  It looks like </p>        <p>/home/wpsoul/public_html/rehub/wp-content/uploads/thumbs_dir/</p>        <p>Plugin shows you first part of url (this is absolute path of your server), you need to add<strong> /wp-content/uploads/thumbs_dir/</strong> to it. You can also add shedule for optimizing.</p>		<p>Then, click on bulk Optimize tool in plugin settings and optimize all your images in <strong>Media Library</strong> + <strong>Optimize Everything Else</strong></p>				<p>That's all.		</p>		<p>Also, theme has 2 ways for generating thumbnails - with BFI resizer and with standard wordpress resizer. First way is more better, but, note, that this way don't work with CDN. So, if you want to use CDN, you need to disable resizer. Go to Theme options - Global Enable/Disable and disable checkbox. </p>		<p>Also, for better responsive images, theme disables width and height attributes for images, but this can grab some points. If you want to disable this, delete such lines from functions.php</p>		<pre>// Remove thumbnail width and height dimensions that prevent fluid images in the_thumbnail<br>function remove_thumbnail_dimensions( $html )<br>{<br>    $html = preg_replace( '/(width|height)=\&quot;\d*\&quot;\s/', &quot;&quot;, $html );<br>    return $html;<br>}<br>add_filter('post_thumbnail_html', 'remove_thumbnail_dimensions', 10); // Remove width and height dynamic attributes to thumbnails<br>add_filter('image_send_to_editor', 'remove_thumbnail_dimensions', 10); // Remove width and height dynamic attributes to post images</pre>				<hr />			<p>Well. What way do you need to use? It depends on your trafic and plugins. In 80% cases you just need good hosting. That's all. If you want to improve page speed and you have under 1000-2000 users in day - try install Hyper Cache. W3 Total Cache is good if you have high load website because it has many unique options, for example, CDN support, memcache and other. But you need to have VPS or dedicated webserver + good knowledge to get all good things from this plugin.	</p>	</div>        </section>               <section class="inline" id="social">                     <!-- title -->          <div class="top-title">            <p>How to make social buttons as on demo site <a href="#home" class="slideTo pull-right"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up"></i></a></p>          </div>          <!-- .title -->                    <div class="wrap">            <p>Steps:              </p>            <p>1.
